üìù Project Description:
This project explores the rich and vibrant Shaadi culture of India, delving into its traditional roots, emotional significance, and modern transformations. Indian weddings are not merely ceremonial unions but grand cultural events that symbolize familial unity, social celebration, and spiritual connection.
